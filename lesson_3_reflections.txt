When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to use the repository on a different computer or with more than one contributor.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The local commits may not be ready for public use.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a Github exclusive feature. They are a "copy" of a repository created in your account with links back to the original.
Clones are copies of repositories without a link to the original.
Branches are used to extend the project, but not affect the current version.
